Hacking Game: 


1. Create menus:
    1a. Shop - (Fixed balance and inventory issues.)
    2a. Inventory - (Player inventory shows when user has item and store updates showing when inventory is bought.)
    3a. Hacking Options - (Fixed try again option and added counter to shower player how many tries they have left.)
    4a. Contracts (Not started)
    5a. Exit


1A. Create the shopping menu:
    Network Scanner LAN/WIFI
    What items are available to buy?
    Wifi attacks
    Network attacks
    Viruses
    IDS detection
    Prices? Upgrades? 
    Can the player sell the items back?


2A. Inventory:
    list, able to add and remove items
    Keep track of how many items are in the Inventory
    Keep track on money for the player
    Keep track of completed tasks or just new ones and remove once complete?

3A. Hacking Interface: 
    When hacking into systems, create an interface to show the company logo for the system you are hacking into
    Once in, show menu options  /  Hacks should be able to get player admin access to more menu options for better rewards but will be more problems
    *******************
    Hacking menu items:
    Provide stats of the hacking tools
    Provide the level of the hacking



Types of Contracts:
For Hire  <--- menu
Dark Web  <--- menu 
Reward for contracts <-- When to give the reward?
Shop contracts <--- Vendor may need some help or may want to break into his bosses computer ?



****************************************************************************************
Extra Addon idea after the game is stable and basics are complete.
    How does the player keep track of the contacts?         <-- Quest type of system?
    How do you make sure the player has the correct items needed for the contact?
    Is there a penality for not completing the contract within a period time?
    Can the player do jobs for the shop in order to get a better discount on future items?
    Does the prices go up or go down within the shop depending if the player fails the contracts?
    Create a separate file for all functions
    Create a sepearate file for menus to be displayed


Exit:
Good Bye!
